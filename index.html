excuses:

"I don't have time

or more  
creatively...

"I could be coding

20% vs 80%

.right-footnote.mini[80% is obviously an estimate, but one based on  
the experience of many project managers. Some even tracked it. *gasp*]
---
or, to put it  
another way
---
Look at all  
![hotness vs crap](images/hottness_vs_crap.png)  
the suck!
---
Why?
---
Because you've  
got no tests!
---
Your code ==  
<img src="images/broken_image_icon.gif" width="198" height="204" />
---
and .em[you don't know it.]
---
You  
<img src="images/broken_image_icon.gif" width="198" height="204" /><br />
their code
---
and .em[they]  
don't know it.
---
Furthermore : 
---
Tested code is  
eliminated .em[faster]  
when debugging.
.right-footnote[4 out of 5 doctors agree.]

???

Tested code is eliminated faster

* if there's a suspect with no 
test and one with a test you're 
more likely to find the bug 
in the untested
* if all your code is tested 
you can quickly see which tests 
cover the problematic situation
and quickly elimate another suspect.
---
You won't spend time  
"getting it working"

.right-footnote[when you *know* that it works from the start]
---
But
---
"I don't have time."
---
generally means:
---
.full["I don't have time .em[to learn]  
how to do it / do it well, and  
I want to write real code now."]

And that's just

short-sighted

"Code coverage"

Java is .em[littered]  
with simple  
getters & setters.

Make sure everyone
